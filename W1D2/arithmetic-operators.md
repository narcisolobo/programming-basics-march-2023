| OPERATOR | DESCRIPTION                  |
|----------|------------------------------|
| +        | Addition                     |
| -        | Subtraction                  |
| *        | Multiplication               |
| **       | Exponentiation               |
| /        | Division                     |
| %        | Modulus (Division Remainder) |
| ++       | Increment                    |
| --       | Decrement                    |

### Arithmetic Operator Example

```

## Assignment Operators

| OPERATOR | EXAMPLE | SAME AS    |
|----------|---------|------------|
| =        | x = y   | x = y      |
| +=       | x += y  | x = x + y  |
| -=       | x -= y  | x = x - y  |
| *=       | x *= y  | x = x * y  |
| /=       | x /= y  | x = x / y  |
| %=       | x %= y  | x = x % y  |
| **=      | x **= y | x = x ** y |

### Assignment Operator Example
```js
var myName = 'Narciso';
```

## Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description                       |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| ==       | equal to                          |
| ===      | equal value and equal type        |
| !=       | not equal                         |
| !==      | not equal value or not equal type |
| >        | greater than                      |
| <        | less than                         |
| >=       | greater than or equal to          |
| <=       | less than or equal to             |
| ?        | ternary operator                  |
